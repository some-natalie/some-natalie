# Hi there 👋🏻

I'm Natalie, a DevSecOps engineer and consultant experienced in developer experience and consolidation within a wide array of security-focused environments.  I work at the intersection of technology, people, and highly-regulated industries as a Principal Solutions Engineer for Public Sector at [Chainguard](https://chainguard.dev)!

### 📝 I write about tech, what I'm working on, and what I'm playing with on [my blog](https://some-natalie.dev).  Here's what I've been up to lately:
<!-- START_SECTION:latest_posts -->
1. [Inspecting pull requests to understand behavior changes](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/github-actions-changes):  ... or how I learned to stop blindly merging every Dependabot PR for GitHub Actions, negating the benefit of pinning to a SHA to begin with, and love YARA rules.
1. [Giving technical talks in sales](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/talks-in-sales):  Blurring the line between engineering and sales isn't _always_ a bad thing ... just be transparent about which side you're on at the moment. 😊
1. [Searching for secrets in container images](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/secrets-in-layers):  How container scanners look for secrets in container images is no secret.  It's easy to DIY.  Let's go for a hunt! 🎯

### 💼 Day to day, I work with

- **Linux** (mostly RHEL and Ubuntu these days) - [fedora-acs-override](https://github.com/some-natalie/fedora-acs-override)
- **Kubernetes** - [kubernoodles](https://some-natalie.dev/kubernoodles), self-hosted GitHub Actions runners made for humans
- **Software development in highly regulated industries** ([ITAR](https://www.pmddtc.state.gov/ddtc_public), [CMMC](https://dodcio.defense.gov/CMMC/), [NIST 800-171](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/171/r2/upd1/final), DoD IL 2-6)
- **Python** - [Advanced Security CSV export](https://github.com/advanced-security/ghas-to-csv)
- **Go** - [gh-org-admin-promote](https://github.com/some-natalie/gh-org-admin-promote)
- **GitHub Enterprise** - [enterprise security team](https://github.com/advanced-security/enterprise-security-team), [audit and compliance reporting](https://github.com/github/platform-samples/tree/master/sql)
- but mostly, I work with people on all of the above! 💖

You can find me in our work Slack sharing all sorts of neat things you can do with all that fun stuff and probably find out how I've broken and maybe fixed something too. 😀

### 👾 I play with

- All sorts of handy Raspberry Pi projects, including
  - [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) set up on a television for local media ([build directions](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/kodi-setup/))
  - [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org) router ([build directions](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/openwrt-setup/))
  - [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net), for DNS and ad-blocking ([build directions](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/pihole/))
  - Ubiquiti UniFi network controller, in [Docker](https://github.com/jacobalberty/unifi-docker) of course
- I'm getting into the [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/) lately - it's so handy _and_ mischievous! ([some fun uses](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/flipper-at-home/))
- Video games in a Windows VM on my Fedora desktop with libvirt, KVM, and a custom Linux kernel to pass hardware to it.  It's got about 5% or so performance drop (just looking at frame rates) over a native install.  You should check it out - [code](https://github.com/some-natalie/fedora-acs-override) and [write-up](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/fedora-acs-override/) on how it works.

I have an awesome life outside of tech, so while I have a few projects that I enjoy, nothing above is close to where I spend most of my time / energy.  If you need anything of mine above fixed, please feel free to fork it and send me a pull request! ❤️
