# Hi there 👋🏻

I'm Natalie, an engineer and consultant focused on cybersecurity, developer experience, and enterprise consolidation within a wide array of high-security environments.  I work at the intersection of technology, people, and regulated industries as a Solutions Architect at [XBOW](https://xbow.com)!

### 📝 I write about tech, what I'm working on, and what I'm playing with on [my blog](https://some-natalie.dev).  Here's what I've been up to lately:
<!-- START_SECTION:latest_posts -->
1. [There I FIPS’d it - misadventures in federal cryptography](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/fipsd-it):  From [DistrictCon: Year 1](https://www.districtcon.org/speakers), let's talk FIPS done wrong.  Here's the most common footguns I've found in the field, all made by folks who are sure they've done it right.
1. [Enterprise chargeback - can we do this?](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/chargeback-basics):  (part one of ?) Lessons learned the hard way from building and running an enterprise-wide chargeback or user-attribution billing system for tens of thousands of users.
1. [Images have their own risks, too](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/image-risks):  You've locked down your runtime, orchestrator, and hosts.  Now how about what's actually running _inside_ of those containers?

### 💼 Day to day, I work with


- **Container security** - [Container Escapes 101](https://some-natalie.dev/container-escapes-workshop/) and [a gentle intro to container security](https://some-natalie.dev/container-security)
- **Kubernetes** - [kubernoodles](https://some-natalie.dev/kubernoodles), self-hosted GitHub Actions runners made for humans
- **Linux** (mostly RHEL and Ubuntu these days) - [fedora-acs-override](https://github.com/some-natalie/fedora-acs-override)
- **Software development in highly regulated industries** ([NIST 800-171](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/171/r2/upd1/final) and [800-172](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/172/r3/fpd) ([CMMC](https://dodcio.defense.gov/CMMC/)), DoD IL 2-6, but also ITAR and RMF and some FedRAMP and FISMA too)
- **Python** for the most part, sometimes a bit of **Go**, way more **bash** than I’ll admit to, and I’m still not sure if all that YAML counts
- **GitHub Enterprise** - [enterprise security team](https://github.com/advanced-security/enterprise-security-team), [audit and compliance reporting](https://github.com/github/platform-samples/tree/master/sql)
- but mostly, I work with people on all of the above! 💖

You can find me in our work Slack sharing all sorts of neat things you can do with all that fun stuff and probably find out how I've broken and maybe fixed something too. 😀

### 👾 I play with

- All sorts of handy Raspberry Pi projects, including
  - [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) set up on a television for local media ([build directions](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/kodi-setup/))
  - [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org) router ([build directions](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/openwrt-setup/))
  - [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net), for DNS and ad-blocking ([build directions](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/pihole/))
  - Ubiquiti UniFi network controller, in [Docker](https://github.com/jacobalberty/unifi-docker) of course
- I'm getting into the [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/) lately - it's so handy _and_ mischievous! ([some fun uses](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/flipper-at-home/))
- Video games in a Windows VM on my Fedora desktop with libvirt, KVM, and a custom Linux kernel to pass hardware to it.  It's got about 5% or so performance drop (just looking at frame rates) over a native install.  You should check it out - [code](https://github.com/some-natalie/fedora-acs-override) and [write-up](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/fedora-acs-override/) on how it works.

I have an awesome life outside of tech, so while I have a few projects that I enjoy, nothing above is close to where I spend most of my time / energy.  If you need anything of mine above fixed, please feel free to fork it and send me a pull request! ❤️
