# Hi there 👋🏻

I'm Natalie, a DevSecOps engineer and consultant experienced in developer experience and consolidation within a wide array of security-focused environments.  I work at the intersection of technology, people, and highly-regulated industries as a Principal Solutions Engineer for Public Sector at [Chainguard](https://chainguard.dev)!

### 📝 I write about tech, what I'm working on, and what I'm playing with on [my blog](https://some-natalie.dev).  Here's what I've been up to lately:
<!-- START_SECTION:latest_posts -->
1. [Using AI to open pull requests for dependency bumps](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/ai-dependency-bumps):  👻 It's spooky season, so let's do something a little scary ... give AI a teeny tiny bit of power in one of my projects.  I wrote yet another janky workaround for what Dependabot can't do today, now with 🤖 100% more AI! 🤖
1. [End-to-end testing for custom GitHub Actions runners in Kubernetes](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/e2e-github-runner-tests):  Expanding test coverage on your actions-runner-controller images is silly easy, once it's been offloaded to ephemeral Kubernetes clusters.
1. [Container runtime fun time!](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/runtime-funtime):  Let's pull apart the key security risks at each layer of the container ecosystem ... now let's look at the risks to our container's runtime.

### 💼 Day to day, I work with


- **Container security** - [Container Escapes 101](https://some-natalie.dev/container-escapes-workshop/) and [a gentle intro to container security](https://some-natalie.dev/container-security)
- **Kubernetes** - [kubernoodles](https://some-natalie.dev/kubernoodles), self-hosted GitHub Actions runners made for humans
- **Linux** (mostly RHEL and Ubuntu these days) - [fedora-acs-override](https://github.com/some-natalie/fedora-acs-override)
- **Software development in highly regulated industries** ([NIST 800-171](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/171/r2/upd1/final) and [800-172](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/172/r3/fpd) ([CMMC](https://dodcio.defense.gov/CMMC/)), DoD IL 2-6, but also ITAR and RMF and some FedRAMP and FISMA too)
- **Python** for the most part, sometimes a bit of **Go**, way more **bash** than I’ll admit to, and I’m still not sure if all that YAML counts
- **GitHub Enterprise** - [enterprise security team](https://github.com/advanced-security/enterprise-security-team), [audit and compliance reporting](https://github.com/github/platform-samples/tree/master/sql)
- but mostly, I work with people on all of the above! 💖

You can find me in our work Slack sharing all sorts of neat things you can do with all that fun stuff and probably find out how I've broken and maybe fixed something too. 😀

### 👾 I play with

- All sorts of handy Raspberry Pi projects, including
  - [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) set up on a television for local media ([build directions](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/kodi-setup/))
  - [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org) router ([build directions](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/openwrt-setup/))
  - [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net), for DNS and ad-blocking ([build directions](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/pihole/))
  - Ubiquiti UniFi network controller, in [Docker](https://github.com/jacobalberty/unifi-docker) of course
- I'm getting into the [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/) lately - it's so handy _and_ mischievous! ([some fun uses](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/flipper-at-home/))
- Video games in a Windows VM on my Fedora desktop with libvirt, KVM, and a custom Linux kernel to pass hardware to it.  It's got about 5% or so performance drop (just looking at frame rates) over a native install.  You should check it out - [code](https://github.com/some-natalie/fedora-acs-override) and [write-up](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/fedora-acs-override/) on how it works.

I have an awesome life outside of tech, so while I have a few projects that I enjoy, nothing above is close to where I spend most of my time / energy.  If you need anything of mine above fixed, please feel free to fork it and send me a pull request! ❤️

### 🌸 Heads up!
