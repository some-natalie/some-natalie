# k8s-devcontainers

Let's take our [devcontainers](https://containers.dev/) and put them in Kubernetes!

Why?

- Self-hosting things
- Custom hardware access (*requires privileged pods)
- You like [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), but wanted to do way more work for way less functionality
- Résumé driven development - for real, there's Kubernetes and I'm sure a couple other buzzwords you can work in too.
