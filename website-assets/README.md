# website assets

The mono repo that held my website got to be many hundreds of MB before I cleaned it up.  Separating website content from some public assets made everything faster and about a third of the size.  These are the assets that should always be public and discoverable. :love_letter:

- [slimming](slimming/) are examples from a few pieces I did on container size, build efficiency, and security.
- [waiting-on-builds](waiting-on-builds/) is build logs and spreadsheets from [the cost of waiting on builds](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/revisiting-build-times/).
