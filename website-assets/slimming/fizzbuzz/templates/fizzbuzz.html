    <p>
      Enter a number and click submit to see the result. It'll return as
      follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the number is divisible by 3, it'll return "fizz"</li>
      <li>If the number is divisible by 5, it'll return "buzz"</li>
      <li>
        If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it'll return "fizzbuzz"
      </li>
      <li>
        If the number is not divisible by either 3 or 5, it'll say "no fizzbuzz
        for you"
      </li>
      <li>
        If you're cheeky and put it in something not a number, it'll return "not
        a number"
      </li>
    </ul>
