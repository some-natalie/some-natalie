# waiting on builds

I downloaded a boatload of logs from that time I [revisited the cost of waiting on builds](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/revisiting-build-times/).  There are 3 zip files of logs, plus the `build-times.xlsx` sheet to calculate the summary numbers in the blog article.

`larger-runners-calculator.xlsx` is a more generic spreadsheet.
